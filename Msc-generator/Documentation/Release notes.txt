Welcome to Msc-generator!
10/Apr/2010, version 2.4.0

With Msc-generator you can generate signalling charts from a textual descriptions.
This allows easy editing and overview and is a viable alternative to mouse-based
tools, such as Visio or PowerPoint.

The language of msc-generator resembles a bit to the graphviz tool and is documented
in detail in the accompanying pdf file.

Msc-generator works both as a command-line tool and as an OLE server application.
A Linux port is also maintained, use mercurial to obtain the latest snapshot from sourceforge.

Installation on Windows is easy:
Just double-click Msc-generator.msi.

On Linux, I suggest to check out the mercurial repo. It uses automake+autoconf.
The cvs repository contains old v1.x code.
The svn repository will contain the windows code.
