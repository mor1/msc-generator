Undo sucks: ujrarajzol mindig

Zoom bizbaz a View:Onsize-ba.

Add closing parenthesis as arc with error

If label starts with an escape, numbering is inserted to the wrong place.
Do: enum result ProcessOneEscape(const char *s, int pos, int &length, enum whattodo, string &replaceto)
whattodo could be:
- apply: apply to stringformatting
- resolve: resolve style and color names
- just jump over
result should be:
- formatting, OK (replaceto = "" if apply, same string or resolved if resolve)
- formatting NOK (replaceto == same string)
- non-formatting (replaceto == what to replace to)
- regular chars (replaceto == same string)

Take Csh out of Msc. Reorg .yy to make distinction on preprocessor level
(so no need to define all #defines for both modes)

Check if design combo actually detects a missing designlib. 
Then add only one label: ---only plain available---

Expand parallel behaviour
- add valign={top, center, bottom} attribute
- (may add experimental = keyline. Add keyline to DrawHeight as a reference, only arrows and dividers
   should return one)
- add overlap=no attribute to use compress, but downward...
- add these attributes to the style under parallel.valign and parallel.overlaps

Add prev error Shift+F8
Add a spinbutton to page and design combos. Add a spinbutton also to the Full screen floating toolbar, but 
make that read-only. 
Save/Restore the position of the Full screen toolbar (watch out that it is not outside the screen)

...: text; does not hide entity lines. Split entity status into 2 parts: on/off and style.
Entity height should take variable entity shadows into account, because the entitydef style is
only copied to the entity when drawing. Create full style store (map indexed by y) for entities, 
separate from on/off status
Add entity create/destroy
