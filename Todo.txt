In cairo
Alt #1: Add win32_printing_surface_create_with_size
Alt #2: Add a cairo_pdf_surface_set_size like function to the win32_printing backend
Two helpers needed:
  - _extract_pdf_surface - like
  - _cairo_pdf_surface_set_size_internal - like

 Add a test for metafiles
 Allow new function only for metafiles


PLANNED in 3.5
FIX: What is the problem with ex37??? in GNU
