Embedded should not save but update
Problem with embedded doc editing...
Embedded should not start with fixed window size

add multiple pipes
vertical positions should not show as entities

inplace size of editor
zoom combo says 300% initially
mouse wheel should work where it actually points

escape in editor kills it, prepare for a closedown...
search replace for internal
tab for internal editor and auto ident

design lib
update doc
drag and drop files - drag in editor...
try scale=10 for vertical text
