In cairo
Alt #1: Add win32_printing_surface_create_with_size
Alt #2: Add a cairo_pdf_surface_set_size like function to the win32_printing backend
Two helpers needed:
  - _extract_pdf_surface - like
  - _cairo_pdf_surface_set_size_internal - like

 Add a test for metafiles
 Allow new function only for metafiles


PLANNED in 3.1

In 3.0
ADDED: More precise tracking mode
ADDED: long_dashed, dash_dotted, triple and triple_thick line styles
ADDED: More arrowheads (double_*, triple_*, sharp, empty_sharp; also xmul and ymul attributes)
ADDED: A richer variety of block arrowhead (*_empty, added empty_inv and sharp)
ADDED: Combined directional arrow styles such as a<->b<<>>c (also for block arrows)
ADDED: shadow attribute to block arrows and verticals (updated designlib)
ADDED: More space to ... dividers
ADDED: line.corner attribute with bevel, note 
ADDED: global text.format chart option to impact all text (can be part of a design too)
ADDED: SHOW and HIDE keywords (showexplicit flag to EntityDef)
ADDED: Command bye so that file end can be used for comments
ADDED: Add size settings (scale=, x=, y=) to command line and a customized dialog to File->Export
ADDED: AutoSplit mode (also for full screen)
ADDED: Page combo to fulls screen toolbar
FIXED: missing ; at the end of last command creates an empty chart
FIXED: If we select a hint, use the hinted text, not the one in the editor (casedness)
FIXED: allow hint when typing just before another word
FIXED: Hints now do auto-completion
FIXED: Focus always goes back to the internal editor.
FIXED: Move caching from CChartData to a separate object.
ADDED: Scale to all drawing operations. Direct drawing to windows surface & bitmap caching
ADDED: onlyforboxes side requirement for widths
CHANGE: pipe::fromright and vertical::readfromleft are both renamed into "side"

In 2.6
FIXED: Many improvements to parsing, but missing the ; still result in empty chart
ADDED: IntelliSense-like suggestions and auto-completion

In 2.5.6
FIXED: A critical bug (new in 2.5.5): freeze when copying the chart to the clipboard or opening an embedded one

In 2.5.5
FIXED: Under XP now we use cairo_text_path, so it works.
FIXED: after a many line-label terminated with a semicolon TAB works bad in next line
FIXED: Tabbing a multiline label (all of it) works bad
FIXED: Now dropping a file will be equal to opening one (will ask for save and erase undo)

In 2.5.4
FIXED: Notification of new version showed the old version in the dialog.
FIXED: non-empty boxes were not numbered by default even if numbering=yes
UPDATE DOC: with empty escape and numbering updates (formats & multi-level)
CHANGED: Number format was too cryptic, changed to simpler escapes

In 2.5.3
CHANGED: Introduced Context into code
CHANGED: if adding levels just at the beginning of a numbered box, block arrow, etc., decrement that.
ADDED: Multi-level numbering
ADDED: Number formats
ADDED: Possibility to place the number anywhere you want inside a label

In 2.5.2
FIXED again: ... makes vlines dotted till end of chart

In 2.5.1
FIXED: Applying a style kills numbering
ADDED: Add empty escape to allow number style to be different from beginning of text
FIXED: ... makes vlines dotted till end of chart
