In cairo
Alt #1: Add win32_printing_surface_create_with_size
Alt #2: Add a cairo_pdf_surface_set_size like function to the win32_printing backend
Two helpers needed:
  - _extract_pdf_surface - like
  - _cairo_pdf_surface_set_size_internal - like

 Add a test for metafiles
 Allow new function only for metafiles

Switch to cairo 1.10 and the new pixman after summer.
design lib
Re-add escape key to exit in-place editing...
Add a<->b<<>>c
Make divider only within a box
Allow divider to have entities
Add entity create/destroy
Expand parallel behaviour
- add valign={top, center, bottom} attribute
- (may add experimental = keyline. Add keyline to DrawHeight as a reference, only arrows and dividers
   should return one)
- add overlap=no attribute to use compress, but downward...
- add these attributes to the style under parallel.valign and parallel.overlaps
Add a spinbutton to page and design combos. Add a spinbutton also to the Full screen floating toolbar, but 
make that read-only. 
Save/Restore the position of the Full screen toolbar (watch out that it is not outside the screen)
Add size settings (scale=, x=, y=) to command line and a customized dialog to File->Export
Add global text.format chart option to impact all text
Add command bye so that file end can be used for comments
